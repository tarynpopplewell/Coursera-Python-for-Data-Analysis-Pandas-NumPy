# Coursera-Python-for-Data-Analysis-Pandas-NumPy
This is just the work associated with the listed Coursera course I completed. I did all my master's coursework in R and wanted to get familiar with Python as well. The concepts of data wrangling transcend language, but it's good to get a feel for the Python syntax.
